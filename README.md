## Supplementary Materials

### 1. Screen Videos Shown to Participants by Condition

Screen recordings showing what participants saw during the study under the different **(a) Feedback Timing** and **(b) Task Duration** conditions. Audio and visuals are in German, with English subtitles provided. The user query is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

| Condition | File |
|---|---|
| No Intermediate Feedback × Medium Duration | [`NI_no_intermediate_medium_duration.mp4`](NI_no_intermediate_medium_duration.mp4) |
| No Intermediate Feedback × High Duration | [`NI_no_intermediate_high_duration.mp4`](NI_no_intermediate_high_duration.mp4) |
| Plan & Results × Medium Duration | [`PR_plan_and_results_medium_duration.mp4`](PR_plan_and_results_medium_duration.mp4) |
| Plan & Results × High Duration | [`PR_plan_and_results_high_duration.mp4`](PR_plan_and_results_high_duration.mp4) |

### 2. Codebook Qualitative Analysis
